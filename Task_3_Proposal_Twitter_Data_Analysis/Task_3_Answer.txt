Key Findings from Analysis

Important Updates and Alerts: Regularly share critical updates about bank services, new features, and security alerts. For example, if there is a scheduled maintenance or a new feature launch, ensure it's communicated clearly.
Visual Content: Integrate more visuals such as infographics explaining financial concepts, video tutorials on using bank services, and images of community events supported by CommBank.

Considerations:

Visual Appeal: Invest in high-quality graphic design and video production to make the content more appealing.

3. Enhance Audience Interaction
