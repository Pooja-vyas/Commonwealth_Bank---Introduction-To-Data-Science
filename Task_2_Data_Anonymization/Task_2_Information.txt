I have provided you with a data set named “mobile_customers.csv.” This contains information about customers that have signed up for the mobile app in the last three years.

We need you to anonymise this data to hide personal details while preserving any useful information for the data scientists at InsightSpark.

Here are some examples of how you may anonymise a data set:
You could remove columns that don’t provide helpful information for analysis (e.g., names or credit card numbers).
You could mask any columns that can identify an individual (e.g., passport numbers or mobile numbers).
You could categorise personal figures (e.g., age and income) into a bracket rather than a specific number.

First, research the different techniques available for anonymising a data set. Then, edit the data set to create an anonymised data set as a CSV file. When finished, please submit this CSV file for me to review before we share it with InsightSpark.
